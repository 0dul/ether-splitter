# ether-splitter

A story about Alice, Bob and Carol who have some ether to spare.


## Getting started
The goal is to create a smart contract named `Splitter` that will split any ethers transaction received by a specific account into two equal parts sent to two other specified accounts.  
The balance of these three accounts can be consulted via a web application.

### Prerequisite

- nodejs v10.15.2
- react v16.8

## Testing
Test the web application using

### `npm test`
