# How to contribute

That's nice of you to consider contributing to this project, thanks.

I will probably not handle any request but your are welcome to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/0dul/ether-splitter/compare/master...develop?expand=1) if you want to.

Not much to say here. Maybe just remember to have a descriptive message for your commits like:

```sh
$ git commit -m "One-line description of your change
> 
> Optionally with a bigger explanation of what changed and how it is impacting the project."
```

...and to produce a (decently) clean code.
